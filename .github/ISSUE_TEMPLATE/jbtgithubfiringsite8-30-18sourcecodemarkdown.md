"Believing is Seeing"



    
     There is far more truth to say "believing is seeing", rather than the well-known axiom "seeing is believing".  

     I have been humbled in my older age, unworthy of being alive today to share an article with you. The article is entitled "Pope Francis, Eucharistic Miracle in Buenos Aires, Argentina" - go to link. This article, literally of (and for) a lifetime, depending on device functions, may be better viewed through a second link under USEFUL/TOOL LINKS.

     "Only with the eyes of faith do we see Him...". May God bless you.        

Sincerely in Christ,   /L.S./   flawpc

A Lifesaving Unknown MOST DO NOT KNOW! (FIFTH PARAGRAPH, STRICT REQUIREMENT) ~~~ Christian Forgiveness of Others ~~~ What "Forgive" Means ~~~ Recurring Resentment Resurface ~~~ If You Can Not Forgive



(Image above courtesy of Free Christian Gifs - Christian Animations - Clipart, http://fg-a.com/clipart_christian.shtml)

Introduction

     I am a Christian, a member of one of many Christian denominations, a Catholic. For all Christians there is only one religion, Christianity. All are dear to me, including a few I hope will not turn away by my denomination alone. I have no formal education in theology, invaluable as it is, or presume even having informal beyond average. In most of this I am sharing experience. There will be no promotion of Christianity without required time and care, if you knew me it must go beyond that, ensuring a safe competence.


     This writing is divided into four areas on forgiveness of others with headings as follows:
1) Christian Forgiveness of Others, a Strict Requirement,
2) What "Forgive" Means,
3) The Recurring Resentment Resurface, Forgiveness Renewals or Struggle,
4) If You Can Not Forgive



1) Christian Forgiveness of Others, a Strict Requirement


     
          Amazing Strict Requirement


     Forgiveness of others was strikingly emphasized of importance to Lord Jesus. Literally, as expressed by Him, it will be weighing a massive amount, our entire lifetime of sins. It is a strict requirement for God's forgiveness of our sins. It is so important to Lord Jesus that He also made it a part of The Lord's Prayer, the Our Father. [* See the note immediately below that, essentially, the doctrine of sola fide, justification by faith alone, does not apply to the extent relevant here] Mindfulness of it until and at the end of time, but in particular that it is a strict requirement, is undeniable as stated by Lord Jesus for us in the Our Father. Astonishingly important, He did this in a unique way. Its placement order and wording strike a first concern purpose of required prerequisite need, "... a strict requirement. ...", a matter that has amazed Biblical scholars. They follow their astonishment with more discussion on its significance. Catechism of the Catholic Church, par. 2838, et seq., - go to link. An intended strict requirement is clear by Lord Jesus' placement order of the petition within the Our Father, further supported by the words that Lord Jesus used. "This petition is so important that it is the only one to which the Lord returns and which he develops explicitly in the Sermon on the Mount.", ibid., par. 2841 in part. Within the Lord's dying words (though not in some early manuscripts), you will find in the Bible expressed forgiveness of others, for us, for eternity and for all time beyond any, "...Father, forgive them, they know not what they do. ...", Luke 23:34, NAB-RE - go to link. Forgiveness of others is of striking importance and clearly set apart in a way for all to see. If you do not see this, just for a moment I can only ask, please, will you try?

_______________________________

  ⚠  ☛   * Note: 
     Re: Sola Fide. First and foremost, I am relying upon the highest authoritative source of Sacred Scripture, the words of Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God. The doctrine of sola fide, justification by faith alone, should be considered with a fair and open mind. See, e.g., a well analyzed writing by a Protestant denomination member: ".... we need to change what we say so that the warnings of Scripture are no longer ignored. ...", Sola Fide: Salvation by Faith Alone, by Paul Pavao, - go to link. Clearly, I acknowledge only citing one of many respectable views. In any event, 1) if sola fide was a sole determining factor, the Lord's first phrase of the fifth petition of the Our Father, "and forgive us our trespasses," could have been implicitly included within the group of the first three of the seven petitions, those for the glory of God, because Lord Jesus' sacrifice is that sins may be forgiven. Instead, Lord Jesus stated it other than within the first three petitions, by placing it within our needs that the remaining group of four petitions address. It is the first part of the fifth petition, a petition of need, but 2) further, it is joined with the Lord's words of the second part of the fifth petition by a single key word of Biblical scholar interpretation, "as", "as we forgive those who trespass against us,", making this clear that it is a requirement. The Catholic denomination has good reason believing it is expressed as a strict requirement. Likely a significant number of other denominations believe the same, but with opinion an inherent part, I should not state this as an absolute certainty. 3) Even beyond the above, immediately after providing the Our Father for us, at Matthew 6:9-13, KJV - go to link, again, immediately, the very first expressed matter on the Lord's mind, in fact completely centers on the Our Father's fifth petition, on God's forgiveness of us, and our forgiveness of others. Matthew 6:14-15, ibid. 4) Clearly, the Lord explicitly states there that if we do not forgive others, we will not be forgiven. Matthew 6:15, ibid. Whatever justification differences remain among Christian denominations, viz., soteriology (the Lord's work of salvation), forgiveness of others is essential for an expectation of eternal life.                                                                                         
________________________________


A Lifesaving Unknown MOST DO NOT KNOW! (first paragraph immediately below)

     The fifth petition of the Our Father provides: "and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us, [emphasis added]". The second emphasized part has absolutely no secondary meaning whatsoever. It is a first primary purpose of the entire fifth petition. This is not as most believe, merely being mindful of our fair measure of consideration when thinking about GOD'S forgiveness of US. Making this clear, it means we can not expect forgiveness in the first place (the first part of the petition), unless there is forgiveness of others, and this is Lord Jesus' strict requirement. [* See the note immediately above that, essentially, the doctrine of sola fide, justification by faith alone, does not apply to the extent relevant here] Literally, as expressed, it will be weighing a massive amount, our entire lifetime of sins. It is a clearly intended strict requirement by Lord Jesus' placement order of the petition and words used (discussed by the authority link of the second paragraph above). The word "as" that begins the second part is the moment to take notice, a key word of Biblical scholar interpretation. This is for awareness (a warning), for thought, perhaps some need for pause, as our reminder that OUR forgiveness of OTHERS is the Lord's strict requirement. Knowing this why then would you be giving much thought to your own forgiveness before you have cleared your conscience on the matter of forgiveness of others. Basically speaking, honestly, the wrong perception of the words described above is how I wrongly thought of them for 60 years! It has possibility of being the most serious error of a lifetime. Truly, its mere instant recognition did wonders for me. Essential focus on the second part of the fifth petition, of first concern, becomes heartfelt to an awareness of any need for the forgiveness of others, or any needed strength.


     A mere instant recognition of this when mentally reciting these words can make a world of difference contributing to a more heartfelt awareness during prayer, and throughout our days. Living with it becomes a stronger and more natural part of our lifestyle with possibility beyond forgiveness challenges. If realizing the above could save someones life, the remaining subject areas of this writing may well be worth knowing about.



2) What "Forgive" Means

"the heart that offers itself to the Holy Spirit"




     "... It is not in our power not to feel or to forget an offense; but the heart that offers itself to the Holy Spirit turns injury into compassion and purifies the memory in transforming the hurt into intercession.", Catechism of the Catholic Church, ibid., at par. 2843, - go to link.

      Guiding standards of the two following paragraphs should be very helpful towards each individual's direction reaching proper forgiveness. I will be referring to the quotation immediately above. This is not a complete writing on all that may be involved in defining what "forgive" properly means in some cases. Therefore, the following paragraph has two resource links providing more in-depth coverage, especially the second link. Not addressed are, but not limited to, 1) having a wish or cooperation with a particular form of justice for the wrongdoer, or 2) the extent relationships can properly change and, related in some cases, 3) a big one, and yes, on acceptance of continuing wrong in some cases.

     ".... Forgiveness means different things to different people. Generally, however, it involves a decision to let go of resentment and thoughts of revenge. ....", Forgiveness: Letting go of grudges and bitterness - Mayo Clinic, by Mayo Clinic Staff, - go to link. Adding to this is another view that forgiveness with God requires one to release the wrongdoer of any obligation to them from their wrong, even a mere apology, Delve Into Jesus : Devotionals : Forgiveness, Forgiveness, by Michael Lane, Executive Director, Delve Christian Ministries, - go to link. Please refer to this link if my one line summary is overly concise. All of the above are very important in almost all cases (therefore, not necessarily absolute), subject to a word of caution. Although very helpful, they should be considered together with intercession that the first quotation points to. I believe they should not distract focus from intercession.

     The considerations above may complement intercession in forming prayers of intercession. Certainly intercession is the most correct and higher standard. In prayers for others (not necessarily limited to the wrongdoer alone), in particular, starting prayers for the wrongdoer, it is hard. It may even feel strange praying for something you do not feel when you are asking it. Joined with God, "the heart that offers itself to the Holy Spirit" in effort so dear is well beyond comfort in His hands. Saying the least, it is most correct. Of course, it is far more.

    I have no reason to believe anything above is necessarily absolute, including intercession. However, I personally believe intercession should be seriously considered. In my opinion, almost any decision that applies an absolute rule is improper if it is not that of God.
    
     With significant or life-changing matters, discussed below, there still may be a recurring resentment resurface struggle to contend with that, safely, should be expected.
    
   


3) The Recurring Resentment Resurface, Forgiveness Renewals or Struggle



     With significant or life-changing matters, many people, perhaps most are unaware that forgiveness of substance often requires lifelong mindful renewal. It can mean a struggle, even defeat. It is resentment that, generally, naturally resurfaces. The struggle some people endure can temporarily or permanently create an unforgiving state of mind. Lack of its awareness is unusual, especially not sensing in anyone a slight awareness when speaking about their forgiveness, not even its renewal, yet a struggle. In fact, in large part and fairness, people are actually unaware.

     Although people are significantly unaware of resentment resurface, there likely is also some lack of being genuine in an outward appearance of no awareness through words or demeanor. This is especially so because it has possibility of being beyond a struggle, only limited to lifelong. Indeed, in an instant the struggle was acknowledged reality at slight mention to a priest.


        Truly, the Power of Prayer is Realistic & Amazing

     First, please have patient understanding with this lengthy discussion on prayer. Unbelievable to many, truly, being very realistic, it goes to the root of the problem, and it is the cure.

     First, resentment resurface, or forgiveness of others in general, seems significantly controlled by one's free will to begin viewing forgiveness as a serious spiritual matter. Consider along with that, for me the answer avoiding more than slight encounters with resentment resurface is to always try staying close to Lord Jesus. I need daily sincere prays, including the Our Father, with both the "Essential focus", and if in doubt, a prompt time reserved for thorough consideration. Having an issue with resentment resurface may indicate concern about the thought process in general, but especially during prayer. The key is trying to STAY close to Lord Jesus, and this is where the problem resides. Readers will see room for improvement here in reaching and maintaining that key goal.

     "  "... when we pray, do we speak from the height of our pride and will, or "out of the depths" of a humble and contrite heart? He who humbles himself will be exalted; humility is the foundation of prayer, Only when we humbly acknowledge that "we do not know how to pray as we ought," are we ready to receive freely the gift of prayer. "Man is a beggar before God." [Internal citations omitted] ", Catechism of the Catholic Church par. 2559 in part, - go to link.

     There is a line of thought following a cliché that causes issues, but innocent ones (basically). It stems no less in part from a line of thought following total belief in a socially acceptable, popular cliché, "you are the person you say you are". Well, how can that be wrong?

     Please take one moment to view the portrait of Apostle Saint Peter near the top of this blog? After this, a few may already sense this is going in the direction of being real with God, by humble awareness of our human weaknesses. Apostle Saint Peter is a gem of humanity, sure hard, indeed, and not an uncut stone.  John 13:38/21:15-17 NAB-RE - go to link/- go to link; Catechism of the Catholic Church par. 1429 - go to link. I do not believe the cliché should change. However, there is hope for awareness of human weakness within, but especially if actually trying to use the cliché in matters brought before God. We are only human. Carrying a mark of humility, you know that you can do no more than try your best. One's blessing from an experience by God serves far more than humility now. God's intention is vast with Apostle Saint Peter's experience. It is so distinctly beyond that it most certainly was, and always remains well-intended educational value for all.

     I believe it is wise to have at least some proper reservation in all cases, that you do not fully know yourself. Forget social acceptability nonsense. If you can not agree with this, then please strive to your limit. Now, however, let us get very real about matters brought before God, because it clearly goes without saying. Not clearly understanding this, at least others will see a very real and serious communication impediment. Almost all of us do have a problem with it though. Remembering it.

     I gloss over matters I would like to later write on my forehead. I am not really deeply perceiving matters, after all, that is going to take more time. The problem then is both 1) remembering we do not fully know ourselves, and importantly, 2) slowing down on occasion.

     Sincerity from a humble heart in prayer is the most important factor, truly, with God the Holy Spirit gradually guiding a humble heart through in prayers. If you do not think there is a problem, do not expect the blessing of feeling when there actually is one. Never is this to be taken for granted, thereby being abused (with possible further loss beyond measure). Please believe me saying that this blessing is very real. If the blessing occurs, at least I expect to very consciously work for it, or any communication whatsoever from God! Again, it is very real.

     In this one lifetime, this is the very time for trying your best to mean ever word that you say, intending this as a thought out purpose at times. Merely on occasion, slow down, but as extremely slow as you can, even for much needed pause during prayer (and perhaps even extensive thought long afterward), avoiding quite natural memorized words of repetition. I bow prostrate mindful, knowing God the Holy Spirit can do wonders for you, if you will only allow.

     If I do not know of a problem myself, how can I be held accountable? I believe that I do not get off that easy. If you persevered, having done some work, possibly blessed discovering an actual problem by doing so, this may provide an answer to the question for some. If you did not at least try, how much faith do you really have? HUMBLE.

     Back to resentment resurface itself as a problem, rather than regular, humble, sincere, and thorough prayer that avoids it in the first place. I believed that I struggled with resentment resurface for many years, believing then that I was falling into relapses of a questionable or unforgiving state. Crucially however, at the time I was unaware that forgiveness of others is a strict requirement for God's forgiveness of my sins, that literally, as expressed by Lord Jesus, will be weighing a massive amount, my entire lifetime of sins.
    
    
        Merely the "Essential focus" Alone Can Do Wonders


          
     Necessarily, based on recollection, my last statement requires explanation. My struggle was more in the nature of sporadic, brief daze, possibly some subtle pain, by flash-back thoughts. Without full awareness, I was actually still trying to reach an adequate settled forgiveness. Whatever progress was superficial, followed by what I thought were sporadic renewals. Respectfully, I must believe beyond mere coincidence, but lacking verifiable fact certainty believe what you may, I began experiencing manageable control with forgiveness of others shortly after gaining knowledge of the "Essential focus" above.

     Awareness of resentment resurface per se is helpful, but safely assume insufficient. It is the power of prayer with mindfulness of its consideration, if not need being addressed, that adds strength and insight over time. Through openness in prayer with awareness, even pain, proclamations of "forgive" as if casting it in fixed stone, some notable examples being to the media or in a courtroom, are open to any need of revived strength from Which they were formed. Of course, their words are an unforgotten tribute to God the Holy Spirit within, preciously dear that had, and still have meaning that transcends.

     "...To forgive from the heart means that our forgiveness has to be a well thought out and deliberate decision that must be renewed frequently... If our forgiveness is truly from the heart, it just cannot be a one-time thing but an ongoing decision to forgive continuously no matter what....". Forgiveness From the Heart: Why and How?, by Fr. Nnamdi Moneme, OMV, Catholic Exchange, - go to link.

     ".... Be aware that forgiveness is a process, and even small hurts may need to be revisited and forgiven over and over again. ....", Forgiveness: Letting go of grudges and bitterness - Mayo Clinic, by Mayo Clinic Staff, - go to link.

     As stated, the answer for me avoiding more than slight encounters with resentment resurface is always trying to stay close to Lord Jesus.




4) If You Can Not Forgive



     If you can not forgive, even if outright, you clearly do not want to, rather than ignoring or holding it in, repeat it in your prayers respectfully. Certainly, bringing sins to be retained before God may per se appear lacking in respect, but respect is all that is needed in doing so. Remember, "God is love", 1 John 4:8, 16, NAB-RE - go to link. Well, of course, God welcomes a loving heart, even having wrong beyond our imagination. Likely, you will be amazed now, or knowing Lord Jesus you may well be. Heaven will not rumble by your prayers. I believe you may catch the attention of all heaven though. Whether aware, because for some awareness takes almost forever or never occurs, there is a closeness to God for a heart that needs healing. This remains open in this lifetime, and I believe thereafter in ways known to God alone that justly considers free will. Vicariously imagine the ability to clearly see one you love so dear from a distance, but they cannot see you, nor do they want you, and living with that for "some time". I believe specially, and relevant here, "[t]he LORD is close to the brokenhearted, saves those whose spirit is crushed.", Psalm 34:18 [19], a Psalm of David [NAB-RE] [- go to link]. See also, 1 Samuel 22:2, in NAB-RE on David joined with those "embittered" - go to link, and two NAB-RE notes - note Psalm 34, "The psalmist, fresh from the experience of being rescued (Ps 34:5, 7)", can teach the “poor”, those who are defenseless, to trust in God alone (Ps 34:4, 12)." - go to link, and 1 Samuel note 22:2, on "Embittered" and "David becomes a hero for those who have endured loss or deprivation." - go to link; And last, Certainly NOT least, Lord Jesus, Luke 4:18, 4:16-20, KJV - go to link. You see, so I lied! --- I believe for a person of special interest, there is going to be such a massive lasting rumble of all-out party joy rock and roll so unforgotten the saints in heaven may very well tell you about it later.         

     True forgiveness is God's domain. Of course, the sufficiency of forgiveness involves considerations and complexity well beyond any proper human description. However, it is reasonable for us to believe that all mindful efforts say a lot and are not forgotten. Clearly, it is also reasonable believing it is fatal error not placing it before God or lacking mindful efforts. When there exists disregard of meaningful efforts, and having fear or regret placing it before God will provide the ability to forgive, and you do not want to, or anything of this nature, it is a serious matter. If so, please, promptly schedule a private, in-person discussion about it with an authorized representative of the Lord in our World today.

     Please, at least take this major step: have some discussion to the extent you will allow, a telephone call, even a mere brief mention in passing.

Blind Faith is Not Expected ~ So Do the Work, Weigh the Facts, Credibility .... But Fairly ~ Begin Trying to See for Yourself ~ and Consider Taking a Trip



     Addressed is a miracle and its facts, still existing to this day and therefore, available for reasonable verification by anyone to this day. Also, there are trips** for verification that the facts disclose. Respectfully making this clear for everyone, THIS (most respectfully) can not be a matter open to reasonable dispute whatsoever by anyone, that is, rationally and reasonably in truth deep within. It would be morally improper raising questions of doubt without first investigating the facts. The facts are contained within an article excerpt forming part of the background to my lead post, Believing is Seeing, including its cited article, Pope Francis, Eucharistic Miracle in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

     The article excerpt, provided below, can also be found at either of the following two links: Eucharistic Miracle? ‘Bleeding Host’ Phenomenon Reported in Dioceses Worldwide | ncregister.com - go to link OR an Internet Archive page capture - go to link. It is as follows:
   
....

Then Gomez arranged to compare those lab reports with the ones from the Eucharistic miracle of Lanciano, Italy. That miracle took place during the eighth century. A priest-monk suffered from doubts about Transubstantiation, wondering if the bread and wine really did become the Body and Blood of Christ. He prayed for help believing it was true. At the Consecration of one of his Masses, the Host changed into a circle of flesh, and the wine became blood before the eyes of numerous witnesses. The Host-turned-flesh and the wine-turned-blood, without the use of any form of preservative, are still present more than 1,300 years later in a reliquary at St. Francis Church in Lanciano. They have been scientifically tested a number of times, with the last one being in 1970. [Emphasis added]

** Although also touring another site(s) in Italy, a mere quick Internet search for Lanciano, Italy, resulted in at least two groups touring there. With any tour group of this nature, you should rightfully assume and likely receive a gracious welcome in joining them.

Significant Wrong in the Axiom "You Can Forgive, But You Cannot Forget"



(Image above courtesy of Free Christian Gifs - Christian Animations - Clipart, http://fg-a.com/clipart_christian.shtml)


     There is a very popular generally accepted axiom lacking justice due to God by overlooking the value of God's important blessing. I could not let this go without an attempt at correction.          

     The axiom "you can forgive, but you cannot forget" is a general accepted truth limited in complete accuracy, so it generally is no surprise, certainly not disgust knowing it has some exceptions. Well, it is to me, now. It only recently became disgusting. I explained in one of the post above, A Lifesaving Unknown MOST DO NOT KNOW!, that for 60 years I had the wrong perception of the essential words of the Our Father's fifth petition, but now know they can be viewed as a mandatory warning (because it actually is). I had no problem with the axiom in the past, lacking that proper recognition and its benefits. I can now understand why it became a commonly accepted axiom, but know it is both significantly wrong, and misleading, but in a disgusting way. It is a jaw dropper. Forget the World's thought and defining source of "forgive" above that of our Lord Jesus, and significantly, as you will see, forget its "forget" too. It lacks knowledge about God, so unknowingly, it lacks a sense of acknowledgment and justice to God.

     Basically and realistically speaking, the thought process behind the axiom calls "forgive" what is in essence nothing more than a resolution to forget a wrong, even a very firm one, spins its wheels with it a few times, gets nowhere, except far enough to sure know "you can not forget". Honestly, almost unbelievable, the axiom is as simple as that. This is purposely brief making it even clearer how simple naive the mindset behind the axiom is, with a mere initial spiritual minded question all should have: whether "forgive" is even true or not? See above, A Lifesaving Unknown MOST DO NOT KNOW!, 2) What "Forgive" Means. The World's "wisdom" on this one is so pathetic, so intellectually lacking, it is a disgrace to humanity. It is missing so much you question if it could have come from a group of human beings. After all, the initial spiritual minded question alone is enough to possibly even make a staunch atheist forced to go that far concede. 

     No, it says something so much more important about us. Far above all other creatures, we have hearts seeing good in trying to forget, even if it can't be done (we are outstanding)!

     "... It is not in our power not to feel or to forget an offense; but the heart that offers itself to the Holy Spirit turns injury into compassion and purifies the memory in transforming the hurt into intercession.", Catechism of the Catholic Church, ibid., at par. 2843, - go to link.

     Matters join on sacred ground where a purification of memory occurs with God the Holy Spirit. Significantly, there is an absence of pain and bitterness. Approaching humbly in prayers and throughout, sandals off so to speak, a heart so humble it goes blind aspiring to wrongdoer intercession somehow within sight (with awareness of the "Essential focus" of A Lifesaving Unknown MOST DO NOT KNOW!, fifth paragraph), in essence and fairness we do forget to a significant degree. Now it is my time, ALL will know, I bow prostrate mindful there may be less or other than any of this acceptable to GOD.

     What do you mean, "you cannot forget"? Even without the help of God, memories tend to fade, but God's important blessing taking the pain and bitterness out of it makes a world of difference. Trust in surrendering to God the Holy Spirit within, but for your release and healing, by placing matters in the hands of God. "'To forgive is to set a prisoner free and discover that the prisoner was you'. - Lewis B. Smedes", quoted in Delve Into Jesus : Devotionals : Forgiveness, Forgiveness, by Michael Lane, Executive Director, Delve Christian Ministries, - go to link. It requires your free will, but now even jokingly saying "surrender hands up" is totally ruled out, with more question whose hands up here, and if so, why? Seriously, for real and for sure, NOW is the time.

     This forgiveness can be noteworthy for all, so I have hope some hearing the axiom will, when appropriate, at least make quick mention of this all-important exception.


          May God bless you.

Interior Conversion of Heart
     



(Image above courtesy of Free Christian Gifs - Christian Animations - Clipart, http://fg-a.com/clipart_christian.shtml)



     My hope is to contribute, even in the slightest degree, to the salvation of at least one soul, and to a deeply perceived obligation, mentioned below, of much more, far unmet.



     Virtually all have a conscience, and at times it is the need to show true concern for others more tangibly in some way (excluding family and friends). In my case (and I believe, only a few others), having that basic conscious awareness, even acting on it, was just not good enough. If it is God's will, so-called “gentlemen" as this can receive the dearest and most certain blessing - to endure a painful, yet salutary interior conversion of heart – and SO BEAUTIFUL! I believe Psalm 51 - go to link  is the first recorded description of the blessing (commonly The Miserere (Latin "have mercy"; Vulgate Psalms [50], Miserere mei, Deus secundum - i.e., distinguished/preeminent to others with a similar title - and to many today, it is the most famous, NAB-RE, note Psalm 51 - go to link, of the seven Penitential Psalms - go to link); also, 2 Cor. 7:8-12 - go to link  describes the experience to some degree), without identifying it by name. It seems a rare few (being few of few others) cannot or will not catch on - yes, hardcore, long-term, and again, yes (here’s Johnny!) me too. To change their fixed morals, their "learning curve" is likely beyond their normal lifetime - it curves the globe and will spin the head of any type of human educator trying to change them. The conversion offers love and forgiveness beyond any human capacity known to man, except One. Please understand if you can, but for God, the experience and changes brought about would not happen. I am confident that a consensus of our current medical profession specialists would agree (and probably already have throughout the world and history). Only God knows why some “gentlemen" like this receive even more blessing - longevity - to complete their experience, and into a lifestyle that necessarily must include well-taught and grateful self-imposed introspection throughout, promptly as needed. Therefore, who am I to criticize as I have in some of my posts here? The answer is: "alive today". In fact, based upon the foregoing, at appropriate times with care and due concern for the feelings of others, I believe I am obligated. Psalm 51:13[15]-15[17] - go to link  , [NAB-RE].


     You have to give businessmen in suits (or a man digging a ditch) credit for trying to maintain their status as gentlemen. The moral question is whether they can actually be gentlemen, absolutely throughout, if they lack a good heart - further, what label could one give that deficiency (not that you should)? Realizing that only God knows, I now look with and to the heart of every man and woman above everything else, and I mean everything. I am very serious in this bottom line statement, including every word when I state: forget money and success, or even making a living, if anyone (or anything) attempts to bend your morals (but for God or, if it is possible, His authorized representatives in our World today) - in ways we do not understand, well beyond not understanding me now, you will be just fine, perhaps great.

ADDENDUM - Interior Conversion of Heart 


     After completion of an interior conversion of heart experience, one will surely know it. In fact, there may be a very good sense of a job well done (if not a sign)!


     Upon completing the experience, one of my friends was a shocked eye-witness to a miracle involving sacramental matter, and in my presence (with absolute scientific recurrence and near certain calculation without variables, about 1 in 1,000, with variables, say 1 in 700). I also saw everything and made an unforgettable mental note of matters, but retained a silent reservation of some doubt. Although uncertain, in retrospect, within about one year after the event, I began to believe (and after a few years, I strongly believe) it marked the start, a sign to me of a job well done, that I surrendered to belief and, importantly and crucial to everything, that I finally surrendered to correction of my wrong within - also, to continue keeping my mind and eyes open (as I did) for more to follow (as God sure did!). Now today, I know better - the reservation was incorrect, but at the same time, not necessarily wrong - I should retain my right of individual thought, including critical thinking within reason - factual proofs should remain, but I am compelled to consider their rightful admission and in a timely manner, as opposed to past humanly unforgivable delay fueled and inflamed by pretentious excessive critical analysis. So kind - all of the time and patience with me - seriously, some notes eventually lined out warranted and received my additional apology side note! I believe it marked my start, to always remember, and forever try to go much further. As to my lead featured post "Believing is Seeing", it has been well past my time to start "seeing", by accepting and believing, both matters seen and unseen.

Rampant​​ ​​Abuse​​ ​​in​​ ​​the​​ ​​Technical​​ ​​Fields​​ ​​Involving​​ ​​the​​ ​​Web​​ ​​& Computers​​ ​​​(fast​ ​and​ ​easy​ ​too!) 



(Image above courtesy of Free Christian Gifs - Christian Animations - Clipart, http://fg-a.com/clipart_christian.shtml)

​ ​
        
     Although​ ​substantially​ ​retired​ ​and​ ​inactive,​ ​as​ ​a​ ​licensed​ ​attorney,​ ​I​ ​am​ ​bound​ ​by legal​ ​and​ ​moral​ ​rules​ ​requiring​ ​the​ highest​ ​level​ ​of​ ​privacy protection.​ ​I​ ​will​ ​and​ ​must legally​ ​enjoin​ ​any​ ​computer​ ​"games"​ ​to​ ​the​ ​contrary.​ ​These​ ​matters​ ​will​ ​not​ ​be​ ​left​ ​open to​ ​any​ ​dispute,​ ​including​ ​any​ ​unchecked​ ​joker-genius​ ​encroachment.​ ​A​ ​protector​ ​of​ ​my security​ ​interests​ ​cannot​ ​cast​ ​any​ ​doubt​ ​of trust​ ​in​ ​their​ ​role. However,​ ​my​ ​concern​ ​has been​ ​proper,​ ​because​ ​outrageous​ ​events​ ​have​ ​occurred​​ ​in​​ ​​a​​ ​​part​​ ​​of​​ ​​my​​ ​​life. 
  ​ ​
     Invasive Internet​​ ​​advertising​​ ​​and​​ ​​marketing tactics​ ​are​​ ​​troubling​ ​to​ ​the​ ​public,​​ ​​but also​ ​internally,​ ​by​ ​very​ ​well-known​ ​companies​ ​guilty​ ​of​ ​tactics​ ​lacking​ ​tactics,​ ​rightfully earning​ ​a​ ​special​ ​shareholders​ ​meeting​ ​on​ ​the​ ​matter:​ ​being​ ​too​ ​consistently​ ​obvious​ ​of their​ ​invasive​ ​motives.​ ​It​ ​becomes​ ​an​ ​insult​ ​to​ ​our​ ​intellectual​ ​capacity adding​ ​insult​ ​to injury.​ Long-term,​​ ​​it​​ ​​results​​ ​​in​​ ​​a​​ ​​major​​ ​​loss​​ ​​to​​ ​​shareholders,​​ ​​by​​ ​​diminishing​​ ​​the company's​ ​goodwill,​ ​often​ ​one​ ​of​ ​their​ ​largest assets, an​ ​economic​ ​fact​ ​(despite​ ​not being​ ​recorded​ ​on​ ​financial​ ​statements).

     Do​ ​not​ ​allow​ ​this​ ​mentality​ ​to​ ​maneuver​ ​you around​ ​(or​ ​at​​ ​​least​​ ​​do​​ ​​not​​ ​​continue),​ ​or fall​ ​for​ their​ ​part​ ​truth​ ​​statements​ ​of​ ​ads​ ​by​ ​financial​​ ​​necessity​​ ​​or​​ ​​slanted​​ ​​numbers​ ​on their​ ​desirability.​ ​Truly,​ ​I​ ​must​ ​have​ ​a protective​ ​concern​ ​for​ ​those not​ ​already​​ ​​aware​​ ​​of their​ ​clever​ ​promotion​ ​of​​ ​​the​​ sense​​ ​​of​​ ​​sharing,​ ​openness,​ ​transparency,​​ ​​and​​ ​​the​​ ​​spirit​​ ​​of​ community​ ​disclosure.​​​ ​​​Prevailing​​ ​goodness​​ ​​does​​ ​​transpire,​​ ​​and​​ ​​so​​ ​​can​​ ​​one's​​ ​​damage when​ ​there​ ​are indications​ ​of,​ ​and​ ​cooperation​ ​with​ ​disclosure​​ ​​as​ ​a​ ​matter​ ​of​ ​default​​ ​(if not​ ​an​ ​actual​​ ​​setting​​ ​​and,​​ ​​somehow,​ ​reset​​ ​​to​​ ​​their​​ ​​benefit​​ ​​over​​ ​​and​​ ​​over​​ ​​again​​ ​​for​​ ​​you). Likely,​ ​there​ ​is​ ​some​ price​ ​to​ ​pay​ ​by​ ​continuing​ ​with​ ​awareness,​ ​but​ ​more​ ​cautiously. However,​ ​too​ ​often,​ ​the​​ ​​same​​ ​​manipulators​​ ​​open​​ ​​some​​ ​​dear​​ ​​matters,​ ​e.g.,​​ ​​contacts​​ ​​or​ notes,​ ​dear​ ​to​ ​all,​ ​but​ ​very​ ​serious​ ​for​​ ​​me.​ By​ ​second​​ ​​highest​​ ​​court​​ ​​in​​ ​​the​​ ​​nation​ ​directive,​​ ​​in​​ ​​some​​ ​​cases​​ ​​(competent​​ ​​judicial​ ​deference​​ ​​making​​ ​​it​​ ​​rare),​​ ​​an​​ ​​attorney​​ ​​is to VIOLATE A COURT ORDER​​ ​​voiding​​ ​​disclosure, Go > To >> JAIL,​​ ​​then​​ ​​be​​ ​​released​ ​pending​​​ ​​​their​​ ​​review.​​​ ​​​Let me assure you, there is a rampant major problem with Web/computer companies proudly admitting they comply with court orders for disclosures without any indication of awareness whatsoever or acknowledgment of the law governing principal-agent, generally requiring notice first prior to disclosures (allowing legal challenges to the orders before all is lost once "the cat's out of the bag").

     Their​​​ ​​​tactics​​ ​​are​​ ​​outrageous​​​ ​​​for​​​ ​​​all,​​ denying​​​ ​​​basic​​​ ​​​online​​​ ​​​individual​ ​dignity​​ ​​in​​ ​​privacy,​​ ​​and​​ ​​they​​ ​​must​​ ​​truly​ ​understand​​ ​​this.​ ​A​​ ​​billionth​​ ​​of​​ ​​a​​ ​​penny​​ ​​profit​​ ​​per​ ​strike,​​ ​​sure​​ ​​troubling​​ ​​massive​​ invasion​​ ​​by​​ ​greed​​ ​​to​​ ​​so​​ ​​many​​ ​​if​​ ​​fully​​ ​​aware,​​ ​​should​​ ​​lead​ ​to​​ ​​an​​ ​​awakened conscience.​​ ​​It​​ ​​is​​ ​​beyond​ ​me,​​ ​​so​​ ​​I​​ ​​pray,​​ ​​at​​ ​​least​​ ​​some​​​ ​​​will​​​ ​​​acknowledge​​ ​​the​​​ ​​​truth,​​​ ​​​with​​​ ​​​serious occupation​​ ​​adjustment​​​ ​​​consideration.   
  
​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​Wrongful​ ​motive​ ​of​ ​retained​ ​security dependency​ ​has​ ​been​ ​obvious​ ​in​ ​the​ ​past​ ​by the​ ​programming​ ​practice​ ​of​ ​my​ ​PC​ software​ ​company.​ ​However,​ ​the programming even​ ​went​ ​so​ ​far​ ​as​ ​to​ ​make​ ​matters​ ​worse​ ​the​ ​longer​ ​I​ ​did​ ​not​ ​comply​ with​​ ​​its​​ ​​false​ ​warnings,​​ ​​or​​ ​​warnings​​ ​​that​​ ​​could​​ ​​not​​ ​​be​​ ​​followed​​ ​​due​​ ​​to​​ ​​impossibility.​​ ​​Unbelievably,​​ ​​I was​ ​eventually​ ​stripped​ ​of​ ​administrator​ ​status without​ ​ability​ ​to​ ​even​ ​set​ ​up​ ​a​ ​new Internet​ ​connection​ ​on​ ​a​ ​computer​ ​that​ ​I​ ​rightfully​ ​owned!​ ​You​ ​can​ ​believe,​ ​as​ ​they​ ​do, that​ ​and​ ​any​ ​and​ ​all​ ​other​ ​types​ ​of​ ​damage​ ​and​ ​wrong​ ​on​ ​their​ ​part​ are covered​ ​in​ ​their contract.​ ​Clear​ ​contract​ ​law​ ​abuse​ ​is​ ​rampant​ ​in​ ​the​ ​technical​ ​fields​ ​involving the Web and computers,​ ​including​ ​fast​ ​and​ ​easy​ ​too.​ ​So​ ​expect​ ​some​ ​mention​ ​on​ ​it​ ​to​ ​follow​ ​this,​ ​with advance​ ​warning​ ​for​ ​the​ ​comfort​ ​zone​ ​some​ ​believe​ ​they​ can​​ ​​continue​​ ​​enjoying​​ ​​with​ ​their​​ ​​army​​ ​​of​​ ​​attorneys​​ ​​(and​​ ​​best​​ ​​count​​ ​​again,​​ ​​they​​ ​​may​​ ​​amount​​ ​​to​​ ​​less​​ ​than​​ ​​one).  
  
​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​The​ ​fields​ ​of​ ​computer​ ​science​ ​lack governmental​ ​professional​ ​ethical​ ​regulation.​ ​It most​ ​certainly​ ​is​ ​a​ ​profession​ ​(and​ ​some),​ ​without​ ​need​ ​to​ ​refine​ ​or​ ​analyze​ ​technical levels​ ​or​ ​relied​ ​upon​ ​source​ ​criteria​ ​defining​ ​a​ ​profession.​ ​Seriously, their self-initiative and admirable​ ​efforts establishing​ ​entities​ ​having​ ​ethical​ ​commitments​ ​for membership​ ​should ​be properly acknowledged and always remembered.​ ​However, of course excluding those adhering to ethics, by self-initiative yet, legal​ ​expectations fall below professional ethical expectations, and overall it even falls short of both. Members of regulated true professions wear one heavy irremovable cloak, not of privilege, that can drain them of energy, even health: their​ ​members​ ​can​ ​be​ ​ordered,​ ​but​ ​in​ ​effect​ ​told​ they are​ ​out​ ​of​ ​"business",​​ ​​so​​ ​​to​​ ​​speak,​​ ​​permanently​​ ​​or​​ ​​temporarily​​ ​​here​​ ​​and​​ ​​now!​​ ​​It​​ ​​is​​ ​​a heartfelt​ ​concern in the back of their minds,​ ​​ever-present and daily, ​to the extent actually considered with every ​word and with every action​ - that heartfelt. Without​ ​it, you can​ ​expect​ ​some​ ​wrong​ ​I​ ​have​ ​observed,​ ​but​ ​the​ ​sense​ ​of​ ​immunity​ ​from​ ​wrong​ ​by corporate​ ​size​ ​and​ ​contract​ ​provisions​ ​I​ ​will​ ​never​ ​get​ ​over​ ​(fast​ ​and​ ​easy​ ​too!).​ ​Law​ ​or equity​ ​does​ ​provide​ ​for​ ​their​ ​needs​ ​with​ ​one​ ​competent​ ​attorney's​ ​ability​ ​to​ ​take​ ​down a​ ​giant​ ​and​ ​army​ ​of​ ​attorneys,​ ​in​ ​addition​ ​to​ ​state​ ​and​ ​federal​ ​governmental​ ​legal​ ​minds actively​ ​assigned​ ​to​ ​this​ ​area​ ​.​ ​Fast​ ​and​ ​easy,​ ​no,​ ​generally,​ ​subject​ ​to​ ​many​ ​variables, you​ ​can​ ​not​ ​rely​ ​on contract​ ​law​ ​to​ ​protect​ ​those​ ​mentalities​ ​and​ ​their​ ​entity​ ​behind​ ​its false,​ ​fraudulent,​ ​misleading,​ ​or​ ​deceptive​ ​practices.​ See, e.g., a couple of partially related information links: State Laws Chart-List - go to link, FTC Bureau of Consumer Protection - go to link. Although​ ​numbers​ ​do​ ​not​ ​count​ ​as much​ ​with​ ​law,​ ​at​ ​times,​ ​they​ all​​ ​​join​​ ​​together​​ ​​in​​ ​​consumer​​ ​​protection​​ ​​or​​ ​​deceptive trade​​ ​​practices​​ ​​actions,​​ ​​in addition​​ ​​to​​ ​​Computer​​ ​​Fraud​​ ​​and​​ ​​Abuse actions. ​            ​

Cybersecurity ~~ When the Money Enters the Billions, the "Bad Guys" Can Out-Smart Our "Good Guys" Appearing Confusingly Overpowered ~ a Matter Beyond Mere Luck



(Image above courtesy of Free Christian Gifs - Christian Animations - Clipart, http://fg-a.com/clipart_christian.shtml)




     I am addressing the theft​ ​of​ ​$81​ ​million​ ​from​ ​the​ ​Federal​ ​Reserve​ ​Bank​ ​of​ ​New York. Hopefully I am not being totally offensive or adding insult to injury to the many good people out there, especially those representing justice. 

     I am​ ​old​ ​and​ ​a​ ​novice​ ​with​ ​computers, but​ ​everyone​ ​realizes​ ​the​ ​deception​ ​on​ ​the​ ​Web.​ ​Anything​ ​that​ can​ ​somehow​ ​connect​ ​to it​ ​is​ ​vulnerable​ ​to​ ​the​ ​outrageous. Admittedly, coming from me it is outrageous trying to address a matter I believe is effecting national security, i.e., cybersecurity. However, almost unbelievably, rather than involving technical issues as you would expect, this by far involves matters of human nature and instinct, matters in which I have acquired reasonable knowledge in my older age.

     I must state that clearly there should be no doubt,​ the​ ​"top​ ​good​ ​guys"​ ​will​ ​be​ ​one​ ​step​ ​behind,​ ​not​ ​ahead​ ​of​ ​the​ ​"top​ ​bad​ ​guys". I am sorry to say, it is not a matter of mere luck - the top bad guys do out-smart our top good guys (only for the moment at that specialty of their crime). As discussed, even if the bad guys were only partially successful in pulling off their plan, it was more than a matter of mere luck. The point here is, let's stop the nonsense of dead silence about this, including any statements whatsoever to the contrary.

     The federal government is an example of a sector of the Internet hardest hit having most obligation to speak out about it publicly, clearly and routinely advancing public good. Basically, it has a near dead silent track record. One of the federal​ ​government’s horrifying​ ​experiences is the theft​ ​of​ ​$81​ ​million​ ​from​ ​the​ ​Federal​ ​Reserve​ ​Bank​ ​of​ ​New York.​ For magnitude perspective, the facts clearly show the real target of the thieves was in the low billions. I am only including a little background falling short to even call facts. For a full understanding, you should inquire further (in a technically competent manner). If guest experts for public television news media were obviously very concerned, including visual demeanor too, I was also concerned then and may remain so for the rest of my life. In considering this, keep in mind that this was still an ongoing criminal investigation at the time - but I believe most likely true, although uncertain - quite some time after the event the news media somehow was able to add that there still was no idea who exactly received the money! This gave the sense that we likely had, and still have, one big $81 million dumbfounded fiasco. After all, where's the money?!! That $81 million was very real and never was or will be pocket change to me. Respect and​ ​honor​ ​open​ ​to​ ​humility​ ​are proper,​ ​especially​ ​through​ ​prudence​ ​by​ ​historical​ ​facts. Is​ ​it​ ​wrong​ ​to​ ​assume​ ​history​ ​repeats​ ​itself? When​ ​wisdom​ ​surmounts​ ​education​ ​and knowledge,​ ​what​ ​is​ ​inconsistently​ ​wrong with​ ​that? When​ ​one​ ​having​ ​knowledge​ of extremely​ complex​ ​matters,​ ​to​ ​the​ ​extent​ ​of​ ​providing safeguards​ ​for​ ​openings​ ​or pathways​ ​and​ ​closing​ ​them,​ ​then​ ​begins​ ​a​ ​specialty​ ​of​ ​actually​ ​planning​ ​with​ ​them,​ ​it​ ​is likely​ ​more​ ​than​ ​mere​ ​luck​ ​when​ ​things​ ​even​ ​partially​ ​worked​ ​out​ ​as​ ​planned.​ The fiasco described also provides that clear impression. However, in this case, at least by outward appearance, our good guys even appeared overpowered. As it is stated above, the unspeakable credit the top bad guys get no longer is, and I am sorry it was also blunt considering its disgust, but this way it could not be any clearer. No, it is not just this simple, but in areas of​ ​this​ ​nature the conclusion is a clear fact of life. From geniuses, by now this undeniable general truth should already be handled with creativity, strength, character, and class making it known to all, e.g., even by common axioms.

      Both business and government are of concern. Common public knowledge would result in a significant reduction in security breaches nationally. Even if this is wrong, especially from government, it would still fall short of an obligation of fair disclosure and the spirit of our Democracy. 

     Maintaining the status quo reflects a wrongfully staunch proud mindset, is self-serving, and lacks humility that shows the respect our good people deserve. It reaches beyond a moral issue and is a matter of human obligation. We are the only creatures with capacity for freedom from non-instinctive independent choice that is rational with a conscience, part of God's overall plan. From government, for their pride they sway towards the direction of an authoritarian state defying the Spirit of God, and Democracy. Everything here involves character maturity. Hopefully those of concern have maturity to give this some thought.
     
     There should be​ ​firm understanding​ ​and​ ​mindfulness​ ​of​ ​this​ ​by​ ​business​ ​and​ ​government in our nation.​ One of the primary​ ​problems​ ​we have is​ ​being​ mindful​ ​of​ ​this irony​ ​of​ ​wrong​ ​in​ ​life​ ​without​ ​being​ ​misled​ ​by​ those forming claims​ to​ ​the​ ​contrary, that are also misled, but by clearly self-serving economic motives.​ ​They perpetuate the​ ​problem​ ​with​ ​more​ ​wrongful​ ​irony,​ ​succumbing​ ​to​ that natural​ ​instinct, because in matters involving security or justice​ and national​ ​concern, it is a legally prohibited instinct. Again, let's stop the nonsense, especially any statements whatsoever to the contrary.

     Both far more open and public candidness are required. Let​ ​there​ ​be​ ​no​ ​doubt about​ ​it,​ ​with​ ​open public​ ​admissions,​ ​and​ ​a​ ​healthy​ ​slap​ ​to​ ​our​​ ​popular​​ ​​public​​ ​​opinion​ ​too.​​ Always keep in mind, everyone knows if our good guys were foolish and cold-hearted enough to enter their domain for a while, they wouldn't stand a chance.

     In the interest of what may perhaps lead to a fair perception, viz., because it is contrary to what one would expect, it appears that the state and federal government sector ranks low in cybersecurity tests.

            Sincerely in Christ,  /L.S./  flawpc

A Fair Definition of "Truth"

A Fair Definition of "Truth"


First and foremost, Lord Jesus is the Truth. John 14:6; Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC), par. 2466. However, in defining "truth" here, my intention is respectful, with care that, overall, in most cases, sufficient factual considerations are included and it generally allows an appropriately balanced perception between discretion and disclosure. However, often it is prudent or necessary to go far beyond this, even obtaining professional advice. Considering a matter such as "truth", a certainly authoritative and very credible source is relied upon below, the CCC. There is much more valuable information at the source used, but unstated here. See CCC par. 2464 et seq., URL: http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s2c2a8.htm


"Truth" is defined through its selected excerpts. The excerpts begin with a one-line rule, followed by what hopefully achieves the appropriately balanced perception, as follows:


".... . Truthfulness keeps to the just mean between what ought to be expressed and what ought to be kept secret: it entails honesty and discretion. ....", CCC, supra, par. 2469, in part.

....

"The right to the communication of the truth is not unconditional. Everyone must conform his life to the Gospel precept of fraternal love. This requires us in concrete situations to judge whether or not it is appropriate to reveal the truth to someone who asks for it.", CCC, supra, par. 2488,

"... The good and safety of others, respect for privacy, and the common good are sufficient reasons for being silent about what ought not be known or for making use of a discreet language. The duty to avoid scandal often commands strict discretion. No one is bound to reveal the truth to someone who does not have the right to know it.*", * fn. 282, citing Sir 27:16; Prov 25:9-10, CCC, supra, par. 2489, in part.


A clear reading of the above will observe its appropriate reserve, by emphasis or weight on the side of discretion or discreet language, rather than disclosure or language of that nature. The commonly accepted norm, compared to the above, seems simple-minded, at times, even outrageous. There is an obvious widespread misconception that "truth" necessarily means the literal truth.

God Has Given Us His Personality to Know & Love ✝ Guidance in Daily Words & Actions
✝



Surely, Lord Jesus wants us to try our best remembering another blessing He has given to take with us, His heart with His personality. By this, we have come to know Him, to love and aspire to emulate, carrying this with us for use throughout our days.

At times, when trying to apply this, what the Lord optimally desires and what I offer could lead to a weakened and sorrowful conscience, but for the special heartfelt sense that "... all is well between us. ...". They have become words so dear to me, always remembered and hoped for.

I know about the narrow gate (Mt. 7:13-14, and narrow door, Lk. 13:23-30), and at times, prefer a strict reading somewhat more than average (while outraged within by simple-minded literal interpretations undermining Christianity, in fact, feeding atheism). Nevertheless, considering some evidence of what the Lord has actually applied to us, knowing Lord Jesus, I may be well in the end. Can you believe the length of the Our Father!?

In Christ, Son of God, Lord Jesus ✝, Sacred is Your Name, Sincerely ❤, /L.S./ flawpc

~ QUOTATIONS:
"The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise." Psalm 51:17, KJV.
"Those whom I love, I reprove and chastise. Be earnest, therefore, and repent." Revelation 3:19, NAB-RE.
"But the LORD said to Samuel: Do not judge from his appearance or from his lofty stature, because I have rejected him. God does not see as a mortal, who sees the appearance. The LORD looks into the heart." 1 Samuel 16:7, NAB-RE.
"The LORD is close to the brokenhearted, saves those whose spirit is crushed." Psalm 34:18 [19], NAB-RE [19].
"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."..."Blessed are the clean of heart, for they will see God." Matthew 5:3, 8, NAB-RE.
"For thus says the high and lofty One, the One who dwells forever, whose name is holy: I dwell in a high and holy place, but also with the contrite and lowly of spirit, To revive the spirit of the lowly, to revive the heart of the crushed." Isaiah 57:15, NAB-RE.
Psalm 22, In part: "...for my clothing they cast lots.", Psalm 22:18[19] in part, NAB-RE [19]. See also, John 19:23-24. The Source of prophecy is Divine, and pre-orchestration also, not human, but emanating from God without any tainted human deceit. This was recorded perhaps 1,000 years before Lord Jesus' passion. The clothing of the executed went to the executioner, and if more than one executioner, it was probably common to divide the clothing into equal shares. Having to cast lots was NOT common. Cf., e.g., NAB-RE, Mt. note 27:35. Psalm 22, in its entirety, is far more than a gem.
"Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. Not as the world gives do I give it to you....". John 14:27 in part, NAB-RE. See also, Philippians 4:7. The peace of God surpasses all understanding.
" " ' "Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, [then] I will enter his house and dine with him, and he with me." Revelation 3:20, NAB-RE.
"Time is the most precious quantity that we have". Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, William H. Rehnquist, shortly before his death in 2005 (exact or near exact quotation based upon personal memory).
Abraham Lincoln, Part of Quotation: ".... I believe, if we take habitual drunkards as a class, their heads and their hearts will bear an advantageous comparison with those of any other class. There seems ever to have been a proneness in the brilliant, and the warm-blooded, to fall into this vice. ...." Abraham Lincoln (1809–1865), U.S. President.>>>>> This may very well be true (perhaps untrue). I certainly like what it says, its kindness, and the hope it will be copied to enhance love, relationships, or spirit (NOTE: Copied and used properly, including any applicable information provided through this linked content).>>>>> Title: Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln. Volume 1, page 278. Temperance address delivered before the Springfield Washington Temperance Society, on February 22, 1842, by Abraham Lincoln, Esq.

It had to be a case much earlier than the one cited below, but when in law school, the first time I clearly understood a Supreme Court of the United States opinion (a sure "good part" at least) was when I ran into the quotation below. After decades, I still commonly use the phrase "even a dog knows the difference" (even some knowing about it say it too!) Here, after all, absent obvious ill will, a dog is possibly quicker and more accurate than we are, but regardless, this sure is true, here's proof, and you figure out how! "[Quotation in part]. . . . In the words of Justice Holmes, 'even a dog distinguishes between being stumbled over and being kicked.' " [IT'S CLEARLY TRUE! FINALLY, I CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD SOMETHING I WAS READING, AND IT IS OBVIOUSLY UNFORGETTABLE!] Smith, 74 Calif. L. Rev., at 1251 (quoting O. W. Holmes, The Common Law 3 (1881)). . . ., quotation adopted in C & A Carbone, Inc. v. Town of Clarkstown, 511 U.S. 383, 423 n. 12, 114 S.Ct. 1677, 128 L.

Be Aware (and Beware) of Law in the Hoosegow
✒

Be aware (and beware) of law in the hoosegow! Based upon foreign word harmony (law of Hobson-Jobson, https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/law_of_Hobson-Job), the etymology of hoosegow indicates it is derived from Latin American Spanish juzgao, almost unbelievably, meaning court (or courthouse (?)). Hoosecow and hooscow are an alternate spelling of the more correct, more sure correctional hoosegow. See Wiktionary: hoosegow ((hoosecow and hooscow) / juzgao, https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hoosegow).

However, also see Urban Dictionary (https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=hoosegow), stating in part, "hoosegow [is defined as] a prison, a jail (from Juzgao, an early Mexican Spanish word for a tribunal court). [Exemplified usage is:smirk: He almost went to the hoosegow when the police confused him with someone who was suspected of a crime.".

So what's the value in this. Be creative, e.g., tactfully weave this into your fiasco ruckus since you plan on getting locked up anyway - then you'll have a valid argument while on appeal for complimenting the judge in calls for order in his hoosegow! *

* Of course, I am absolutely joking, always having utmost respect for the entire civil and criminal justice system.
